# scripts
functions and all other identifiersâ€”primitives and objects.

literals such as object,array, and regular expression literals

objects in JavaScript = key - value /*  hash tables of key - value pairs */

The values can be properties = primitives /* primitive number, string, and boolean values */ or other objects; 
The values can also be functions in which case they are called methods.

Many of the properties of the built-in native objects are also mutable.
